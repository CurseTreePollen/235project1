## Images and Sources
All of the images are my own and are from projects I worked on.
The code is mine too, though I think I learned the overhead thing from a website.  I admittedly do not remember which site this would be, as I made that change quite a while ago.

## Above and Beyond
Admittedly, I don't think I did much that could be considered above and beyond.  I was a bit pressed for time, and had not really thought about it too much.  I still like what I made, but it is definitely on the simpler side.  Sorry about that.
