# My Portfolio
(Bus Troubles, need to finish writing, will finish before morning)

## Creation
Before I really started working on the portfolio, I looked at a couple of the examples given.
I really liked the vertical designs, so I started off by making a navbar and id sections.

I initially had a longer intro section instead of the tagline, but I did not really know what to put in there, so I removed it and later added the tagline in its place.
I added 2 images for the projects section, and started the About Me and Contact Info, though all of that stuff was placeholder or incomplete.

I also made my site red for some godawful reason.  I have no idea what the hell I was thinking at the time.  Maybe I wanted it to match my Project 1?  In any case, I scrapped that, and switched to a black, white, and gold color scheme.

Before that though, I messed around with the flex, put the projects in spans, and found out about .overhead so the headers would not have an unreasonably long line beneath them.

When I finally got back to the project, I finished up my contact info and, as I mentioned, changed the color scheme and removed the intro section.  I also added a link to the top of the page, and put in a Twitter button.

I also messed around with my formatting a little.  I messed with the My Work section by adding a 3rd project (Project 3) and by giving the descriptions their own spans (The initial plan was to put them under the images but in the same span).
On the note of the images, I replaced and resized them to better fit the layout.  I also messed with them to make sure they would stay in the spans.

## Images and Sources
All of the images are my own and are from projects I worked on.
The code is mine too, though I think I learned the overhead thing from a website.  I admittedly do not remember which site this would be, as I made that change quite a while ago.

## Above and Beyond
Admittedly, I don't think I did much that could be considered above and beyond.  I was a bit pressed for time, and had not really thought about it too much.  I still like what I made, but it is definitely on the simpler side, and is lacking in some areas.
