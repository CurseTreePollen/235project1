                    If you couldn't tell, my idea is somewhat derivative of League of Legend's Miss Fortune.  Back when I played League <em>a lot</em>, I liked her character, or at least the idea of a character like her, but I was less than satisfied with how she was in-game.  As such, my younger self went and thought about how I would design MF. That idea stayed around in my head, and when this project came around, I built off of it (specifically, my reimagined Double-Up) and came up with what I described in the proposal.  That said, this game is definitely going to focus only on that ricochet shot and the idea of hiding in plain sight.  No firing waves/hails of bullets.
                    <br>
                    On the note of Miss Fortune, the name of this may eventually be changed to <q>Miss Direction</q>.
                    <br>
                    I am a little worried that I may have overscoped, but worst case scenario, I can change it into a pure puzzle game based on figuring out how to hit your target(s) with bouncing bullets.
                    <br>
                    As for the site, I used coolors.co to create a palette based on some colors I got from a color palette generator (returns the palettes of images it is given).  That palette ended up having some problems though, and had to get changed.  The current one admittedly might need some changes too, but should suffice for now.
                    <br>
                    I also kind of realized that I definitely need to review and practice some stuff more, like Flex and Grid.  Hopefully this site will look a little more professional once the final submission is due.
