## Process/Progression

Since I chose to improve upon the GIF Finder code, I obviously started with that.

I was able to add the ratings quickly in class, and later I set up the js and css files and linked them.
Some other things took priority over it, but I eventually got around to re-styling the site, and adjusting it to my taste.

However, from there thing became more difficult.  I ran into issues getting my events and buttons to work, and whenever I thought up a possible solution (and neglected to ask for help b/c I thought I found the answer), it would turn out not to work.
I also don't think I thought through what would go into saving and reloading favorites, and really regret choosing to do that, or at least not asking for more guidance.

Overall, I think I screwed up.  I am submitting what I have for now (I could probably try to do more w/ the favorites, but after everything else not working I really do not feel up for it anymore).  I may try to give it more time and fix at least some stuff over the break, but there are other assignments that I will have to put before trying that.

I will try to do better with Project 3 and the Portfolio. I am sorry.
