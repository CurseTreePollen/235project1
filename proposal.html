            <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p>Sneakily bounce bullets to kill your targets (via bouncing bullets) without arousing the suspicions of people nearby!  Take account for your ammo, alongside the noise your guns, surroundings, and ricochet make!

            <h3>Genre</h3>
                <p>Stealth/Puzzle? Game.  </p>

            <h3>Story</h3>
                <p>
                    The premise of my game is that you are member of a pirate faction, and it is your mission to take out enemies of your crew, whether they be pirates you have bad blood with, or the scum from the old continent.  However, to most outside the crew your membership is secret (a lot of people don't even know who you are), so with a little bit of planning and awareness of your surroundings, you can safely take out targets in public.
                    <br>
                    I guess the closest thing my game would have to themes would be retribution/revenge or action and consequence, given the emphasis on ricocheting bullets and taking out enemies.
                    <br>
                    As for the mood, I suppose it would be somewhat standard/pleasant with a bit of tension.  The people around you may not be tense at the moment, but once they hear something, and/or you complete your mission...
                    <br>
                    For now, the narrative is simply moving from level to level and target to target. I don't want to overscope here (or at least not overscope any more than I may have).

                    <dt>Graphics:</dt>
                        <dd>I was thinking of having fairly simplistic graphics.  Maybe pixel art with a touch of cartoony.</dd>
                    <br>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Simple BGM, possibly just background chatter. Maybe a little bit of music too.</li>
                                <li>Also, noises are produced when hitting targets, firing guns, and interacting with certain objects.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <dt>Mechanics:</dt>
                        <dd>
                            <p> 
                                This game will have basic WASD movement.
                                <br>
                                Aiming/Ricochet: Wherever you point your gun, you'll be able to see its path as a red line. This line includes any ricochet the bullet would make and if it would break anything. Bullets can bounce off of certain objects/walls, and go through/break others.
                                <br>
                                Interaction: Some objects in the environment can be directly interacted with. Maybe it'll make noise, maybe you'll be able to carry or move it, or maybe it'll change the environment.
                                <br>
                                Sound: The TL;DR here would be <q>Something along the lines of Mark of the Ninja's sound system.</q> In other words, shooting and other noisemaking actions would create a circle on-screen, representing the noise they made.  NPCs within the circle would hear the noise and react to it.  This can reveal your location, but it can also mislead NPCs and get them to move somewhere advantageous.<br>

                                <br>
                                Aiming: Mouse
                                <br>
                                Firing: Left Click/Spacebar
                                <br>
                                Interact: E

                        <dd>
                            <p>
                                For now, I was thinking of teaching the player naturally through the game, with little, unobtrusive pop-ups in the beginning to make sure they aren't struggling too much with learning the controls.<br>
                                As for mechanics, I would probably introduce one at a time, and then expand on it and mix it with other mechanics.

            <h3>About the Dev</h3>
                <p>
                    Nice to meet ya! My name is Benjamin Vega, and I am a Game Design and Developement Sophomore at RIT.  This site is here is part of a project (and eventual real game) for one of my classes.<br>
                    
                    Anyway, I know/am learning JavaScript, C#, and HTML, along with Unity, Monogame, and Unreal 4.  I like stories in just about any format (Books, TV, Movies, Games, Anime/Manga, etc.), along with animals and walking around.
