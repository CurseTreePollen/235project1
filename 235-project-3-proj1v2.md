## Take Out Targets with Bouncing Bullets!

A stealth/puzzle game where you are in plain sight!  Sneakily dispatch targets with bouncing bullets and a few other tricks without arousing others' suspicions.  Gunshots and richochets will make noise though, so be careful!  That said, noise can also be useful in certain circumstances...

# Game Treatment/Proposal

![Simple drawing of Miss Fortune using Double Up](/doubleUp.png "Simple drawing of Miss Fortune using Double Up")

### Concept
Sneakily bounce bullets to kill your targets (via bouncing bullets) without arousing the suspicions of those around you!  Take account of the noise your guns, surroundings, and ricochet make, and fulfill your mission!

### Genre
Stealth/Puzzle Game. Each level is effectively a little puzzle where you have to figure out how use your bullets to take out your target.  If someone realizes you were behind the target's death, you will have to try the level again.

### Platform
Desktop only for now, mobile friendly if time/skill allows.

### Story
The premise of my game is that you are a member of a pirate faction, and it is your goal to take out enemies of your crew, whether they are pirates you have bad blood with, or the scum from the old continent.  To most outside the crew your membership is unknown (a lot of people don't even know who you are), so with a little bit of planning and awareness of your surroundings, you can take advantage of their ignorance and safely take out targets in public.

I guess the closest thing my game would have to themes would be retribution/revenge or action and consequence, given the emphasis on ricocheting bullets and taking out enemies.

As for the mood, I suppose it would be somewhat standard/pleasant with a bit of tension.  The people around you may not be tense at the moment, but once they hear something, and/or you complete your mission...

For now, the narrative is simply moving from level to level and target to target. I don't want to overscope here (or at least not overscope any more than I may have already).

### Esthetics
Graphics
  I was thinking of having fairly simplistic graphics.  Maybe pixel art with a touch of cartooniness.
Sound:
  - Simple BGM, possibly just background chatter. Maybe some music too.
  - Also, noises are produced when hitting targets, firing guns, and interacting with certain objects.
  
### Gameplay

Mechanics:

   This game will have basic WASD movement.  
   **Aiming/Ricochet**: Wherever you point your gun, you'll be able to see its path as a red line. This line indicates any ricochet the bullet would make and if it would break anything. Bullets can bounce off of certain objects/walls, and go through/break others.  
   **Interaction**: Some objects in the environment can be directly interacted with. Maybe it'll make noise, maybe you'll be able to carry or move it, or maybe it'll change the environment somehow.  
   **Sound**: The TL;DR here would be "Something along the lines of Mark of the Ninja's sound system." In other words, shooting and other noisemaking actions would create a circle on-screen, representing the noise they made.  NPCs within the circle would hear the noise and react to it.  This can reveal your location, but it can also mislead NPCs and get them to move somewhere advantageous.  
   
Controls:

   Movement: WASD  
   Aiming: Mouse  
   Firing: Left Click/Spacebar  
   Interact: E  

Teaching the Player:

   For now, I was thinking of teaching the player naturally through the game, while also having little, unobtrusive pop-ups in the beginning to make sure they aren't struggling too much with learning the controls.  
   As for mechanics, I would probably introduce them safely and one at a time, and then expand on the mechanic and combine it with others.  

### About the Dev
Nice to meet ya! My name is Benjamin Vega, and I am a Game Design and Developement Sophomore at RIT.  This site is here is part of a project (and eventual real game) for one of my classes.

Anyway, I know/am learning JavaScript, C#, and HTML, along with Unity, Monogame, and Unreal 4.  I like stories in just about any format (Books, TV, Movies, Games, Anime/Manga, etc.), along with animals and walking around.

## Process
If you couldn't tell, my idea is fairly derivative of League of Legend's [Miss Fortune]("https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Miss_Fortune").  Back when I played League *a lot*, I liked her character, or at least the idea of a character like her, but I was less than satisfied with how she was in-game.  As such, my younger self went and thought about how I would design MF. That idea stayed around in my head, and when this project came around, I built off of it (specifically, my reimagined Double-Up, her primary ability) and came up with what I described in the proposal.  That said, this game is definitely going to focus only on that ricochet shot and the idea of hiding in plain sight.  No firing waves/hails of bullets.

On the note of Miss Fortune, the name of this may eventually be changed to "Miss Direction".

I am a little worried that I may have overscoped, but worst case scenario, I can change it into a pure puzzle game based on figuring out how to hit your target(s) with bouncing bullets.

As for the site, I used coolors.co to create a palette based on some colors I got from a color palette generator (returns the palettes of images it is given).  That palette ended up having some problems though, and had to get changed.  I think I found something that works now.
