## Take Out Targets with Bouncing Bullets!

A stealth/puzzle(?) game where you are in plain sight!  Sneakily dispatch targets with bouncing bullets and a few other tricks without arousing others' suspicions.  Gunshots and richochets will make noise though, so be careful!  That said, noise can also be useful in certain circumstances...

# Game Treatment/Proposal

![Simple drawing of Miss Fortune using Double Up]("media/doubleUp.png" "Simple drawing of Miss Fortune using Double Up")

### Concept
Sneakily bounce bullets to kill your targets (via bouncing bullets) without arousing the suspicions of those around you!  Take account of the noise your guns, surroundings, and ricochet make, and fulfill your mission!

### Genre
Stealth/Puzzle(?) Game.

### Platform
Desktop only for now, mobile friendly if time/skill allows.

### Story
The premise of my game is that you are a member of a pirate faction, and it is your goal to take out enemies of your crew, whether they are pirates you have bad blood with, or the scum from the old continent.  To most outside the crew your membership is unknown (a lot of people don't even know who you are), so with a little bit of planning and awareness of your surroundings, you can take advantage of their ignorance and safely take out targets in public.

I guess the closest thing my game would have to themes would be retribution/revenge or action and consequence, given the emphasis on ricocheting bullets and taking out enemies.

As for the mood, I suppose it would be somewhat standard/pleasant with a bit of tension.  The people around you may not be tense at the moment, but once they hear something, and/or you complete your mission...

For now, the narrative is simply moving from level to level and target to target. I don't want to overscope here (or at least not overscope any more than I may have already).
