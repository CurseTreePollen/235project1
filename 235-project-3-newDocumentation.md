## Process (Project 1)
If you couldn't tell, my idea is fairly derivative of League of Legend's [Miss Fortune]("https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Miss_Fortune").  Back when I played League *a lot*, I liked her character, or at least the idea of a character like her, but I was less than satisfied with how she was in-game.  As such, my younger self went and thought about how I would design MF. That idea stayed around in my head, and when this project came around, I built off of it (specifically, my reimagined Double-Up, her primary ability) and came up with what I described in the proposal.  That said, this game is definitely going to focus only on that ricochet shot and the idea of hiding in plain sight.  No firing waves/hails of bullets.

On the note of Miss Fortune, the name of this may eventually be changed to "Miss Direction".

I am a little worried that I may have overscoped, but worst case scenario, I can change it into a pure puzzle game based on figuring out how to hit your target(s) with bouncing bullets.

As for the site, I used coolors.co to create a palette based on some colors I got from a color palette generator (returns the palettes of images it is given).  That palette ended up having some problems though, and had to get changed.  I think I found something that works now.

## Process (Project 3)
Well, in case you couldn't tell, what I have made is a LOT different from what I initially thought up.  I really wanted to make sure I did not overscope, especially after struggling with the last project, so I opted to go for a relatively simple SHMUP instead.

While I initially considered putting Miss Dir in the middle of the screen, and have the player strafe around enemies while hitting them with ricochets and blowing them up, I eventually came to the conclusion that this perspective seemed a bit too far away from my initial intention.

Instead of that, I decided to go with my other early idea, which involved Miss Dir (behind cover) fighting waves of approaching enemies.
